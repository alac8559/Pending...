Beepboop is a web-based Morse code training program that teaches users how to understand Morse code. The website includes a registration and login page, a short tutorial to get users started, a page where they can convert text to Morse code, and a page with a lesson system. The lesson system uses the Koch method to learn Morse code, where users are introduced to two letters to begin with, and a new letter or number is added in each additional lesson. The user can jump to any lesson they want, change how long they want each lesson's practice session to be, and receive feedback on their accuracy in the lesson.
